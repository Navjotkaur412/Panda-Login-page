# Panda-Login-page
The Interactive Panda Login Form is a creative frontend project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a playful, animated panda that reacts to user interactions, adding a fun twist to the traditional login experience.
This form includes fields for username and password, styled with modern CSS and enhanced using Google Fonts for a clean, engaging appearance. The standout feature is the panda face, complete with animated ears, eyes, blush, nose, and paws. These elements respond dynamically to user actions—such as typing in the form—bringing the character to life.

The HTML structure uses semantic tags for clarity and accessibility. CSS is responsible for positioning, animations, and responsive styling, while JavaScript (linked via script.js) adds interactivity, like eye movement or hand gestures based on focus or input.

This project serves as a fun exercise in:

Frontend design

DOM manipulation

CSS animations

User experience enhancement
